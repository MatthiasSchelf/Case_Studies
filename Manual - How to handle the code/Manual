How to handle the data and code. 

Within the Data file you will find three files. 
      One with the raw data.
      One with the prepared data. 
      One with the code that converts the raw data to the prepared data. This code was not made by us but by the original author. 

For our own analyses, you can consult the analysis folder. Within this folder there are multiple files, each with their own seperate analyses.

A couple of things to consider before running the analyses:
      All analyses work on the basis of the prepared data. 
      Make sure to correctly locate the prepared data and indicate where it is on your computer.
      All codes can be ran completely.
      The name of the different codes are straightforward. However, let's discuss one example: H1_MAIA_PBC_General_Bonfererroni.
      This code will give the results of the first hypothesis (which concerns network analysis), in the form of general results 
      with the Bonferroni correction.
