How to handle the data and code. 

Within the Data file you will find three files. 
      One with the raw data.
      One with the prepared data. 
      One with the code that converts the raw data to the prepared data. This code was not made by us but by the original author. 

For our own analyses, you can consult the analysis folder. Within this folder there are multiple files, each with their own seperate analyses.

A couple of things to consider before running the analyses:
      All analyses work on the basis of the prepared data. 
      Make sure to correctly locate the prepared data and indicate where it is on your computer.
      All codes can be ran completely.
      Before running an analysis, one needs to choose to execute either the general condition (a condition in which
      average variables are considered the variables of intrerest) or the specific condition (a condition in which specific variables
      are considered as the variables of interest). Please choose which one you want to execute by putting either the gereral
      or specific part in #comments#.
